# hello-world
my first repository

Hey there to those of you listening,
I'm Caleb and there is SO much I want/have to do. I just started working on a healthcare/software product with a friend and I need to learn a LOT of programming as well as talk to hospitals/doctors to understand the pain points of the target customer. 

We met with a friend this past friday to ask for advice on where to start so here I am. Starting. He told us about computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, loads of APIs and cool tools to use that I'm going to be learning about. I was thinking earlier today that I might be able to use the same principles to help speed the development of my battery company. Hey, we'll see.
